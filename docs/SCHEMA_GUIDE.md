# Schema Guide — customizing Mnemosyne for your codebase

Mnemosyne ships with a **fixed primitives** schema (Section / CrossRef /
ChangelogEntry / FrozenList / InventoryEntry — five closed-form entity
types) and a **markdown pattern → entity** mapping that is fully
config-driven via `mnemosyne.toml`. The atomic store
(`docs/.atomic/workspace.atomic.json`, path overridable via
`[atomic] sidecar_path`) is the single source of truth for typed facts;
the cascade output (`docs/GENERATED.md`, path overridable via
`[atomic] output_path`) is the deterministic human-readable view. This
guide shows the knobs available and the reference presets.

The fifth primitive — **InventoryEntry** — was added in Phase 1A
(Round 273) for stable external IDs with a lifecycle vocabulary distinct
from the audit-trail genre: test case ids (TC8 `ARP_07`,
`TCP_RETRANSMISSION_TO_04`), requirement ids, regulation ids. Lifecycle
states are `active` / `deprecated` / `reserved`; the validator's
inventory citation axis rejects citations of `deprecated` ids and of
unregistered ids.

## Schema schema

Every Mnemosyne workspace is configured by one TOML file. The top-level
tables:

```toml
[workspace]  # required
docs = [...]   # ordered list of doc paths
default_doc = "docs/SPEC.md" # cross-doc reference target

[workspace.spec_source]  # optional — external-spec mirror adopters only
url = "https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/"
revision = "2015-09-01"
fetched_sha256 = "..."   # optional 64-char lowercase hex
fetched_at = "2026-05-27T00:00:00Z" # optional ISO-8601

[schema]   # optional — defaults to mnemosyne preset
changelog_titles = [...]  # which heading titles open a ledger
entry_id_prefix = "Round "  # what opens a ledger entry bullet
anchor_convention = "section_number"
medium_name = "design_doc"

[style]   # optional — defaults to compile-time
locale = "ko"   # sentence-boundary locale tag
[style.thresholds]
max_paragraph_length = 1000
max_sentence_length = 300
max_section_body_length = 5000

[terminology.glossary] # optional — defaults to Mnemosyne preset
"Salsa" = ["salsa"]
"bi-temporal" = ["bitemporal"]

[atomic]   # optional — override default store / cascade paths
sidecar_path = "doc/.atomic/store.json"  # default: docs/.atomic/workspace.atomic.json
output_path = "docs/coverage/SPEC.md"  # default: docs/GENERATED.md

[plugins.set_equality_validator]   # optional — opt into code-citation defense
paths = ["src/"]
severity_missing = "warn"   # | "reject"
severity_binding = "warn"   # | "reject"
severity_inventory = "warn"  # | "reject"  (Phase 1A)
comment_only = true
inventory_prefixes = ["ARP_", "TCP_"]   # multi-prefix for inventory cite axis
external_section_prefixes = ["RFC", "IEEE"]  # `<PREFIX> <NUMERIC> §<id>` skip
external_section_prefixes_bare = ["TR_SOMEIP", "SOMEIPSD"] # `<PREFIX> §<id>` skip (R284)

[[orphan_ledger]]  # optional — register legacy cross-ref carries
doc = "docs/legacy.md"
from = "12"
to = "99"
kind = "markdown_ref"  # | "atomic_entry_ref" | "atomic_section_ref" | "code_citation"
reason = "carried from pre-migration state, see Round 80"
```

Omit any optional table to inherit the Mnemosyne preset.

## The three reference presets

`SchemaSection` exposes three factory presets that cover the common
markdown conventions:

| Preset | `changelog_titles`  | `entry_id_prefix` | `anchor_convention` | Use when    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `mnemosyne_preset` | `["Changelog", "changelog"]` | `"Round "` | `"section_number"` | English design-doc style (this repo)  |
| `generic_default` | `["Changelog", "changelog"]` | `""` (disabled) | `"heading_slug"` | English README + ARCHITECTURE.md w/o numbered ledger |
| `adr_preset` | `["Decisions"]`   | `"ADR-"`  | `"adr_id"`  | Architectural Decision Records (`ADR-NNNN`) |

Empty `entry_id_prefix` disables changelog entry capture entirely — useful
when the project never numbers its history rows.

## What each field actually does

- **`changelog_titles`** — heading titles that put the parser in
 changelog-bullet mode. The parser falls back to a case-insensitive
 match against the literal `changelog`, so `## CHANGELOG` always works
 even if you forget to list it.
- **`entry_id_prefix`** — the literal string that opens a changelog
 bullet. The parser captures digits + dot-separator chain immediately
 after the prefix and emits `entry_id = "{prefix}{digits}"`. Empty
 prefix disables capture; bullets in the changelog section become
 free-form text.
- **`anchor_convention`** — diagnostic label only in the current round
 (Round 144). The parser still derives `section_id` from numbered headings
 (`## 7.` → `"7"`) and slugifies unnumbered titles.
- **`medium_name`** — diagnostic label that flows through MutateReceipt
 + tracing spans for cross-medium debugging. No semantic effect.
- **`style.locale`** — selects the sentence-boundary handler. `"ko"` is
 the current default; `"ja"`/`"zh"`/`"en"` are placeholders that
 currently fall back to the `.`/`!`/`?` terminator set. Deeper locale
 wiring (`。` for Japanese / Chinese, abbreviation handling for German
 / French) is scheduled for a follow-up round.
- **`style.thresholds`** — per-rule char count overrides. Keys must
 match `StyleRule.rule_id` (`max_sentence_length`, `max_paragraph_length`,
 `max_section_body_length`). Unrecognized keys are silently ignored.
- **`terminology.glossary`** — canonical → variants map. The
 `terminology_consistency` rule rejects (T3) when a non-canonical
 variant appears in any doc body.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].paths`** — production source paths to scan for spec
 citations (`Round NNN`, `§<id>`). Test paths intentionally excluded —
 traceability anchors in tests carry a different policy contract than
 rationale in production source. Typically `["src/"]` or
 per-crate `["crates/foo/src/", "crates/bar/src/"]`.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].severity_missing`** — `warn` or `reject`. Fires when a
 citation's target id is absent from the atomic store (hallucination).
 Start at `warn` to surface the baseline, promote to `reject` once
 clean.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].severity_binding`** — `warn` or `reject`. Fires when a
 citation appears in a file that the section's
 `implementations` (Path B Spec ↔ Code binding) does *not* list as a
 backing implementation, *or* when an Active section has zero
 implementations recorded. Bidirectional binding integrity.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].comment_only`** — `true` strips string literals before
 scanning so only comment citations count. Default `true`; flip only if
 your project deliberately puts §id references in user-visible strings.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].inventory_prefixes`** — multi-prefix list for the
 *opaque-ID* inventory citation axis (Phase 1A, Round 275). Each entry
 is an ASCII word (`"ARP_"`, `"TCP_"`, `"SOMEIP_ETS_"`); the scanner
 walks `<prefix>[A-Z0-9_]+` tokens whose tail ends in a digit (the
 digit-terminus rule suppresses identifier-shaped false positives like
 `TCP_BUFFER_SIZE`). Empty list = axis disabled. Longest-prefix-first
 matching: when both `"SOMEIP_"` and `"SOMEIP_ETS_"` are registered,
 `SOMEIP_ETS_BASICS_01` reports once under the more specific prefix.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].inventory_path_prefixes`** — companion axis with
 *section-path* tail shape (`[A-Za-z0-9./-_]+`, no digit-terminus
 requirement). Each entry is a prefix that may include spaces
 (`"W3C SCXML "`, `"IRP "`); the scanner walks
 `<prefix><section-path>` tokens, so `W3C SCXML 3.13`, `IRP test144`,
 `SCXML-D.2.selectTransitions` all match. Targets external-spec
 mirror adopters (W3C SCXML, IETF RFC, IEEE, AUTOSAR family) who
 would otherwise face a mass cite migration to the sigil-prefixed
 form. Resolution target is the same `InventoryEntry` store as
 `inventory_prefixes` — they are two tail-shape axes feeding the
 same lifecycle (active / deprecated / reserved). A prefix may be
 registered in both axes if both citation shapes coexist; the
 scanner dedups so a matching cite surfaces once.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].external_section_prefixes`** — single-token prefix
 list (`["RFC", "IEEE", "ISO/IEC"]`) for the *numeric-document* form
 of external-standard `§` skip (Round 277). Citation form:
 `<prefix> <numeric> §<id>` — same line, with surrounding punctuation
 like `(RFC 791` stripped (Round 281). For *doc-name* standards
 without a numeric document number, see
 `external_section_prefixes_bare` below. Multi-token prefixes
 (e.g., `"ETSI TS"`) are not v1 — register the trailing token as a
 looser workaround.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].external_section_prefixes_bare`** — single-token
 prefix list for the *doc-name* form of external-standard `§` skip
 (Round 284). Citation form: `<prefix> §<id>` — prefix directly
 before sigil, no numeric between them. Used by AUTOSAR family
 (TR_SOMEIP, SOMEIPSD, SWS_SD) and other doc-name-only standards.
 Kept distinct from `external_section_prefixes` so registration is
 an *explicit opt-in* per prefix — see *External standard prefix
 kinds* below for the FP risk on generic-sounding tokens.
- **`[plugins.set_equality_validator].severity_inventory`** — `warn` / `reject` / `info`.
 Fires when an inventory citation's id is absent from the atomic store
 (`InventoryMissing`) or its registered status is `Deprecated`
 (`InventoryDeprecated`). `Active` / `Reserved` ids pass silently.
- **`[atomic].sidecar_path`** — workspace-relative or absolute path
 for the JSON store. Default `docs/.atomic/workspace.atomic.json`. Use
 this to redirect the sidecar into an existing `doc/` tree without
 colliding with `docs/`. CLI `--sidecar` flag wins over this config
 when both are present.
- **`[atomic].output_path`** — workspace-relative or absolute path for
 the cascade write target. Default `docs/GENERATED.md`. This is *not*
 auto-derived from `[workspace] docs[0]` — docs[0] is the parse target
 (markdown the validator reads), while `output_path` is the cascade
 write target (atomic store → md). Keep them independent so cascade
 doesn't overwrite hand-authored content on first mutate.
- **`[[orphan_ledger]]`** — register legitimate cross-ref carries
 (e.g. references to legacy docs you preserved by design). Each entry
 names `doc` / `from` / `to` / `kind` / `reason`. The validator's
 `T1 orphan total` line reports `ledger=N, new=+X, resolved=-Y`:
 ledgered orphans are silent, new orphans bail, and resolved-but-still-
 ledgered entries bail too (forcing you to drop the now-stale ledger
 row). `kind = "code_citation"` covers code-side §-axis citation
 suppression (Path B); `kind = "inventory_citation"` (Round 285)
 covers code-side inventory-axis citation suppression (intentional
 historical references to deprecated / deleted test-case ids).
 See *Self-contained citation rule* below for when to use.

## Field length caps (T3 threshold, surfaced for DX)

The atomic mutate API enforces hard caps on text fields to keep the
audit trail compact and prevent prose drift from creeping into structured
data:

- `intent`: 200 chars max
- `rationale_bullets`, `inputs_bullets`, `outputs_bullets`,
 `caveats_bullets`, `caveat`: 100 chars per bullet

Exceeding the cap rejects the mutate with a clear error; split the text
or move detail into a separate atomic field (`examples`, `rationale`).

## Self-contained citation rule

`validate-code-refs` matches citations on a **single line** with **one
explicit prefix token** in scope. Citations must be self-contained at
their use site:

- ✓ `// RFC 2131 §3.5 client retransmits` — RFC token + section on the same line
- ✓ `// (RFC 791 §3.1) — fragmentation fields` — surrounding `()` stripped (Round 281)
- ✗ `// see RFC 3927 above\n// §2.2.1 says ...` — multi-line context;
 the second line has no RFC token on it
- ✗ `// 2131 §3.1 lease renew` — RFC numeric only, prefix word missing

The two failing forms are *not* fixed by the scanner — broadening
either pattern would push the layer into prose inference and create
false-skips on internal citations (a `§4.2.4` adjacent to a stray
numeric would silently bypass the spec-side reject gate). The
architectural rule is: prefer rewriting the comment to canonical
`RFC NNN §X.Y` form. When mass-rewriting isn't practical (legacy
codebase carry), register the (file, §id) pair in
`[[orphan_ledger]] kind = "code_citation"`:

```toml
[[orphan_ledger]]
doc = "<code-citation>"
from = "src/dhcpv4_client.cpp"
to = "3.1"
kind = "code_citation"
reason = "RFC 2131 §3.1 cited multi-line in DHCPv4 transition prose, retain"
```

The same shape applies to the inventory citation axis (Round 285) —
register `kind = "inventory_citation"` when the code intentionally cites
a deprecated or deleted test-case id (e.g., to document why a code path
deliberately skips a removed scenario):

```toml
[[orphan_ledger]]
doc = "<inventory-citation>"
from = "src/dissect/packet_pipeline.cpp"
to = "IPv4_OPTIONS_01"
kind = "inventory_citation"
reason = "Historical: IPv4_OPTIONS_01..14 deleted V2->V3, documents why dissector skips IP options"
```

Both axes are independent — a `code_citation` row does not suppress an
`inventory_citation` violation, and vice versa. The validator surfaces
the ledger entry under `ledger=N` (silent unless the orphan later
resolves), and the audit-trail records *why* the citation is unmatched
rather than silencing it.

## External standard prefix kinds

External standards identify their documents in two ways, and the
validator's `§<id>` skip layer treats them as **independent axes**
(Round 284) so registration is an explicit opt-in per kind:

| Kind | Citation form | Examples | Config key |
|------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Numeric document number | `<PREFIX> <NUMERIC> §<id>` | RFC 791, IEEE 802.3, ISO/IEC 14882 | `external_section_prefixes` |
| Doc-name short identifier | `<PREFIX> §<id>` | TR_SOMEIP, SOMEIPSD, SWS_SD | `external_section_prefixes_bare` |

Both forms are skipped when the prefix word is registered in the
appropriate axis. Leading punctuation (`(`, `[`, `"`, `«`) is stripped
in both modes (Round 281), so `(RFC 791 §3.1)` and `(TR_SOMEIP §X.Y)`
both match.

**Multi-word names and W3C document forms (Round 379).** A registered
prefix may be **multi-word** — it is matched as a token-boundary suffix
of the prose before the document number (numeric mode) or before the
sigil (bare mode). The document-number token may carry a leading `#`
(Unicode Annex form) or trailing letters (versioned standards). So
W3C-family citations are covered by registering the full standard name:

```toml
external_section_prefixes = [          # <PREFIX> <doc-number> §<id>
  "UAX", "UTS", "UTR",                 # UAX #9 §3.3, UTS #51 §16
  "CSS Color", "CSS Fonts",            # CSS Color 4 §8.1  (multi-word)
  "WAI-ARIA", "WCAG", "IEEE",          # IEEE 802.11ax §… (letter-suffixed)
]
external_section_prefixes_bare = [     # <PREFIX> §<id>
  "Unicode Standard", "Web IDL",       # Unicode Standard §3.12 (multi-word)
  "UCD", "WAI-ARIA",                   # WAI-ARIA cited both ways → both axes
]
```

The verbatim token-boundary match means a registered prefix only skips a
citation whose prose actually *ends with* that exact prefix, so
`SCSS 3 §` does not match `"CSS"` and `random Color 4 §` does not match
`"CSS Color"` — prefer the most specific full name.

**Pick the right axis.** The two-axis design exists so generic-sounding
tokens (e.g., `"AUTOSAR"`) don't silently skip *internal* `§<id>`
citations on prose lines that happen to mention the standard name.
Register the *most specific* form of the prefix you actually cite:

- ✓ `external_section_prefixes_bare = ["TR_SOMEIP", "SOMEIPSD", "SWS_SD"]` — specific document short-names
- ⚠️  `external_section_prefixes_bare = ["AUTOSAR"]` — generic; a prose
 line like `// AUTOSAR cluster startup §2.1` will silently skip the
 internal `§2.1` reference

When a standard supports both citation forms (some IEEE specs are
cited as both `IEEE 802.3 §...` and `IEEE_802_3 §...`), register the
prefix in both axes. The two paths are independent and a citation
matches whichever axis's shape applies.

## Common authoring patterns

### English design doc (this repo)

Just author `mnemosyne.toml` and commit. The Mnemosyne preset is the
default — your spec passes through unchanged, and the validator
recognizes `Round N` entries under `## Changelog`.

### English-only README + ARCHITECTURE.md, no numbered ledger

```toml
[workspace]
docs = ["README.md", "ARCHITECTURE.md"]
default_doc = "README.md"

[schema]
changelog_titles = ["Changelog"]
entry_id_prefix = ""  # no numbered entries
medium_name = "generic"
```

### ADR-style decisions (`ADR-NNNN`)

```toml
[workspace]
docs = ["docs/adr/ADR-0001.md", "docs/adr/ADR-0002.md", "README.md"]
default_doc = "docs/adr/ADR-0001.md"

[schema]
changelog_titles = ["Decisions"]
entry_id_prefix = "ADR-"
anchor_convention = "adr_id"
medium_name = "adr"
```

### Project-specific terminology rules

```toml
[terminology.glossary]
"JWT" = ["jwt", "Jwt", "JsonWebToken"]
"OAuth2" = ["oauth2", "OAUTH2"]
"Postgres" = ["postgres", "POSTGRES", "PostgreSQL"]
```

The `terminology_consistency` rule rejects (T3, blocks commit via
pre-commit hook) when any variant appears anywhere a doc body — the
canonical form is the only valid spelling.

### Code-citation defense (multi-crate workspace)

```toml
[plugins.set_equality_validator]
paths = [
 "crates/foo/src/",
 "crates/bar/src/",
]
severity_missing = "reject"
severity_binding = "reject"
comment_only = true
```

Run `mnemosyne-cli validate-code-refs` to scan; wire that command into
your project's own pre-commit hook to gate every commit. Promote
`severity_*` from `warn` to `reject` once the baseline is clean. To bind a section to its
implementation file (so the binding axis recognizes it as backed), use:

```bash
mnemosyne-cli add-section-implementation \
 --section §3 --file crates/foo/src/auth.rs --symbol Session::validate
```

### Inventory citation defense (test cases / requirement ids, Phase 1A)

For projects citing stable external ids in code — TC8 test cases, ISO
test specs, IEEE conformance ids, internal requirement ids — declare
the prefix family and let the inventory axis check existence + status
at cite time:

```toml
[plugins.set_equality_validator]
paths = ["src/", "tests/"]
inventory_prefixes = [
 "ARP_", "TCP_", "UDP_", "IPV4_",
 "ICMPV4_", "DHCPV4_", "SOMEIPSRV_", "SOMEIP_ETS_",
]
# External-spec mirror adopters add section-path-shape prefixes here:
inventory_path_prefixes = [
 "W3C SCXML ",     # section refs like `W3C SCXML 3.13`
 "IRP ",           # test catalog refs like `IRP test144`
]
severity_inventory = "warn"  # promote to "reject" after baseline clean
external_section_prefixes = ["RFC", "IEEE"]  # ignore `(RFC 791 §3.1)`
```

Register each id via the CLI (or sync from your upstream SSOT):

```bash
mnemosyne-cli add-inventory-entry \
 --id ARP_07 --status active --section §4.2.4 \
 --source "tc8_v3.pdf#row=12"

mnemosyne-cli add-inventory-entry \
 --id TCP_RETRANSMISSION_TO_04 --status deprecated \
 --reason "superseded by TO_05 in TC8 v2.3"
```

`active` and `reserved` ids cite freely; `deprecated` ids reject at
cite time (with an optional cascade scan surfacing existing cite-sites
when a mutate flips status). Lookup via `query --list-inventory` or
`query --inventory <id>`.

### External adopter — redirect store/output to avoid `docs/` collision

Projects with an existing `doc/` (or `documentation/`) tree that wants
to add Mnemosyne without renaming directories:

```toml
[workspace]
docs = ["docs/coverage/SPEC.md"]   # parse target
default_doc = "docs/coverage/SPEC.md"

[atomic]
sidecar_path = "doc/.atomic/store.json"   # avoid docs/.atomic collision
output_path = "docs/coverage/SPEC.md"   # cascade write — explicit
```

The mutate, read, validate, and cascade paths all honor both overrides
(Round 280); there is no split-brain. CLI `--sidecar` / `--output`
flags still win when supplied.

### External-spec mirror

For projects vendoring an external standard (W3C / IETF RFC / IEEE /
ISO/IEC / AUTOSAR family) as a workspace mirror so code citations stay
honest against the spec graph. Two first-class fields plus the existing
atomic primitives cover the pattern end-to-end:

- `[workspace.spec_source]` — workspace provenance (RFC-002 FR-2).
- `AtomicSection.normative_excerpt` — vendored quote anchored to each
  mirrored section (RFC-002 FR-1).

```toml
# docs/spec/scxml/mnemosyne.toml — one workspace per external namespace
[workspace]
docs = ["docs/spec/scxml/SCXML.md"]
default_doc = "docs/spec/scxml/SCXML.md"

[workspace.spec_source]
url = "https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/"
revision = "2015-09-01"
fetched_sha256 = "abcdef0123...64-hex...0123"
fetched_at = "2026-05-27T00:00:00Z"

[schema]
changelog_titles = ["Revision History"]
entry_id_prefix = "Rev "               # spec rev bump → ChangelogEntry append
anchor_convention = "section_number"
medium_name = "spec_mirror"

[plugins.set_equality_validator]
paths = ["src/", "include/"]
severity_missing = "reject"
severity_binding = "reject"
comment_only = true
```

**One workspace per external namespace.** A repo that cites W3C SCXML
*and* the IRP test catalog *and* its own design ledger keeps three
separate `mnemosyne.toml` trees (e.g. `docs/spec/scxml/`,
`docs/spec/irp/`, `docs/design/`) and runs `validate-workspace` once
per tree. Single-`mnemosyne.toml` multi-namespace bundling is *not*
supported — `[workspace.spec_source]` is single-valued by design.

**Commit↔ledger drift gate in a multi-workspace repo.**
`validate-workspace` includes a commit↔ledger drift gate (Round
293/301): it scans recent commit subjects for Mnemosyne changelog round
labels `(R<n>)` / `(Round <n>)` and rejects when a cited round has no
backfilled atomic-store entry. In a multi-workspace mono-repo the scan
is **path-scoped to each workspace's own subtree** (Round 377), so a
round label on a commit that only touched a *sibling* workspace does not
false-flag this one. If your repo's commit convention uses `(R<n>)` to
mean something *other* than a Mnemosyne changelog round (e.g. an
adoption-round counter), downgrade the gate per workspace:

```toml
[commit_ledger]
severity = "warn"   # | "info" | "reject" (default)
```

`reject` (the default) fails the exit code on any missing cited round —
correct when the workspace authors its own `append-changelog-entry`
ledger. `warn` / `info` still print the drift line but do not gate the
exit code, for a pure consumer ledger whose `(R<n>)` labels are not
Mnemosyne changelog rounds. The diagnostic is never silenced; only the
gating changes.

**Atomic store populated from the upstream spec.** Each spec section
becomes an `AtomicSection`; each test case in a conformance catalog
becomes an `InventoryEntry` (Phase 1A) when the id shape fits. Use
`section_id` slugs that stay stable across revisions (e.g.,
`scxml-3.13` rather than `3.13`, so a future spec restructure does not
silently re-key 30K citations).

**Anchor the vendored quote at section creation.** After `add-section`,
call `set-section-normative-excerpt` to embed the spec text:

```bash
mnemosyne-cli set-section-normative-excerpt \
  --section §scxml-3.13 \
  --text-file /tmp/scxml-3-13.txt \
  --anchor-url "https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#event" \
  --source-revision "2015-09-01"
```

The field is **frozen** after first set — once a normative_excerpt is
anchored, the mutate primitive rejects overwrite. To model spec
revision drift, supersede the existing Section
(`set-section-decision-status --status superseded --superseding
§<new>`) and create a new Section carrying the updated excerpt. The
audit trail preserves both revisions in parallel; partially-migrated
workspaces stay coherent because each Section's `source_revision`
records the rev it was anchored at.

**Spec revision drift as ChangelogEntry stream.** When upstream bumps
the spec, append a ChangelogEntry recording the diff and the impacted
sections:

```bash
mnemosyne-cli append-changelog-entry \
  --entry-id "Rev 2026-05-01" \
  --decision "W3C SCXML §3.13 rev 2026-03-01 → 2026-05-01 — semantic delta on Y" \
  --changes-file /tmp/rev-changes.txt \
  --verification-file /tmp/rev-verify.txt \
  --impact "scxml-3.13,scxml-3.14" \
  --carry-file /tmp/rev-carry.txt
```

`AtomicSection.normative_excerpt` is frozen per-Section; the workspace-
wide `[workspace.spec_source].revision` is the *current* rev label.
The ChangelogEntry stream records *when* the workspace moved between
revs; per-Section excerpts capture *what* the section said at the rev
it was anchored at. T2 frozen-ledger semantics apply to the entry
audit half — rev-bump records are permanent.

**Symbol-level binding (record-only).** `Implementation.symbol` accepts
an opaque language-agnostic identifier and is preserved in the store
for project-side audit tooling. The validator's set-equality check is
file-only (RFC-002 FR-3 deferred — language-aware enforcement requires
LSP / treesitter wiring outside Phase 0 paradigm).

**Intentional carries for spec drift.** When an upstream spec *removes*
a section but the workspace must keep citing it (e.g., preserving a
historical compatibility comment), use the existing
`[[orphan_ledger]] kind = "code_citation"` row.

**Markdown prose is cite-able.** The `comment_only` filter strips
code-fenced blocks before scanning, but prose lines outside fences are
scanned the same as code comments — so prose citations in spec
markdown (e.g., a paragraph inside `SCXML.md` referencing `§3.13`)
participate in the validate-code-refs gate. Code fences inside the
prose remain exempt.

## What stays fixed

The five entity types — Section / CrossRef / ChangelogEntry / FrozenList
/ InventoryEntry — are **not** configurable. They are the universal
primitives the validator + mutate API + cascade engine all build on.
What `[schema]` configures is *which markdown patterns* the parser maps
onto Section / ChangelogEntry. The fifth, InventoryEntry, was added in
Phase 1A (Round 273) for stable-id citation hygiene; further entity
types (medium-specific `Character` / `Location` / `Faction` for
narrative products) remain Phase 1+ scope.
