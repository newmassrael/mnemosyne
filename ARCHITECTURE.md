## 1. North Star

> **AI and humans co-author knowledge — specifications *and* narratives — on a
> single bitemporal · branchable · auditable typed-fact substrate. Media are
> swapped via adapters (design_doc / spec / ADR / fiction); domain meaning is
> plugged in (logic = SCE/SCXML, code = tree-sitter); and every artifact —
> readable docs, executable SCXML logic IR, generated code — is a *projection*
> of that one fact substrate.**

Mnemosyne is not a markdown tool. It is the **management / memory / version-
control layer** for evolving knowledge. Its sibling project
[`scxml-core-engine` (SCE)](../scxml-core-engine) supplies the **formal logic
layer**: extended SCXML (Forge kind-system) as a universal IR + multi-language
AOT codegen + the NL↔IR meta-layer between AI and humans. Together they form an
**AI–human co-authoring substrate**: SCE = "what the system *does*" (formal,
verifiable, executable); Mnemosyne = "what is *true when*, what *changed*, and
*why*" (versioned, branchable, auditable).

## 2. The three models are one system

| Model | What it is | Where it lives in the architecture |
|---|---|---|
| **Existing (substrate)** | bitemporal, branch, cascade, audit over typed facts | **Layer 0** — the fact core |
| **Narrative** | fiction + technical both first-class; branch / saga; many media | **Layer 1** — medium adapters |
| **Plugin** | domain meaning plugged in (SCE logic, code symbols) | **Layer 2** — capability plugins |

They are three faces of one statement: *manage one fact over time; swap the
medium with an adapter; plug in domain meaning; project everything else.*

### Textbook patterns applied
- **Ports & Adapters (Hexagonal):** Layer 0 is a pure domain; adapters and
  plugins sit at the boundary. The core defines the ports (`FactStore`,
  `MediumAdapter`, `CapabilityPlugin`); concrete implementations depend inward.
- **Dependency Inversion:** dependencies point toward the core abstractions,
  never outward toward formats or engines.
- **Single Source of Truth:** the canonical typed-fact log is the only truth.
  `GENERATED.md`, SCXML IR, generated code, the RocksDB index — all derived.
- **Event Sourcing + bitemporal:** the append-only fact log *is* the event log
  (this is the existing frozen-ledger principle); current state is a fold;
  valid-time and transaction-time are separate axes.
- **CQRS:** the write side (proposal → gate → audit → log append) is distinct
  from the read side (cascade-recomputed projections).
- **Plugin process isolation:** trusted/fast meaning runs in-process; external,
  multi-language engines (SCE: Python/Rust/Go runtimes) run behind MCP/CLI
  transport — `core::Transport { InProcess | Mcp | Cli }` is exactly this seam.

## 4. Persistence — log is SSOT, RocksDB is the materialized index

The substrate is **event-sourced**:

```
SSOT  (git-native, reviewable)        RocksDB  (rebuildable, gitignored)
append-only fact log            ──→   materialized index keyed by
(canonical facts as JSON;             (branch_id, entity_id, valid_from)
 = frozen changelog ledger)           → fast point-in-time / branch / cascade
```

- The **fact log lives in git as text** — AI and humans review mutations by
  diffing it. This preserves the dogfood's core property (spec change review
  via version control) and *is* the event log.
- **RocksDB is a derived materialized view** rebuilt from the log: the 24-byte
  `(branch_id, entity_id, valid_from)` composite key + per-CF version history
  scans give the bitemporal / branch / cascade queries that a flat JSON file
  cannot serve at scale. Being gitignored is **correct** — a rebuildable index
  is never the source of truth.
- A flat JSON file works only because today's dogfood corpus is tiny (one
  design_doc, one branch). Branching bitemporal narrative needs the index.
- **Future (not a fork now):** at extreme corpus size, add log *snapshots* so
  the index need not replay the whole log on load. Optimization, not a redesign.

## 5. Current state vs target — the debt to converge

The largest remaining deviation is a **duplicated fact model**: the Section /
ChangelogEntry / FrozenList / CrossRef concepts are modeled twice — once for the
live JSON authoring store, once for the RocksDB index codec. (A third, Salsa
per-entity face — `SectionInput` / `ChangelogEntryInput` / `FrozenListInput` —
was removed in R322; cascade now consumes facts through `BranchSnapshotData`
rather than redefining them.)

| Concept | `mnemosyne-atomic` (JSON, live) | `mnemosyne-facts` (RocksDB index codec) |
|---|---|---|
| Section | `AtomicSection` (Layer-0 `SectionSkeleton` + design_doc content) | `SectionFact` |
| ChangelogEntry | `AtomicChangelogEntry` | `ChangelogEntryFact` |
| FrozenList | (in `AtomicStore`) | `FrozenListFact` |
| CrossRef | (in `SectionSkeleton.impact_scope`) | `CrossRefFact` |

Consequences today: two unreconciled persistence models (JSON atomic store =
live; RocksDB store = built-but-orphaned), and a tier-gate concept that exists
both in `validate-workspace` (real) and in `mnemosyne-server` (stub). The write
path that once bridged them through a broken `commit` hashing stub was removed
in R321.

The substrate components are **well-built and kept** — `store` is a correct
bitemporal/branch KV; `cascade` is a correct incremental-projection seed. They
are not dead code; they are *not yet wired*.

### Convergence sequence (each step independently verifiable)
- **A — unify the fact model (keystone).** One canonical skeleton carrying both
  serde (the JSON log) and the byte codec (the RocksDB index). Everything depends
  on this. (R323 hoisted `FactKey`; R325 hoisted `SectionSkeleton` and made the
  live model compose it — see below.)
- **B — RocksDB as materialized index.** Project the log into the composite-key
  store; route queries through it instead of full-JSON scan.
- **C — cascade as incremental projection.** Replace full re-render with Salsa
  incremental recompute on log change.
- **D — unify the write path.** Atomic mutate primitives + proposal→gate→audit
  reconcile into one command path (append log → update index → cascade).

### Canonical fact-model boundary (A's keystone, R323–R325)

`A` splits along a strict Layer-0 / Layer-1 line so the core stays
domain-agnostic (§1):

- **Layer 0 — canonical skeleton (`mnemosyne-core`).** The bitemporal identity
  `FactKey { branch_id, entity_id, valid_from }` (landed R323) and the
  medium-neutral `SectionSkeleton` (landed R325): `title`, parent links,
  `decision_status`, and cross-refs (`impact_scope`). This is all the core knows.
- **Layer 1 — medium content (design_doc adapter = `mnemosyne-atomic`).** The
  rich design_doc fields — `intent`, `rationale`, `inputs`/`outputs`, `caveats`,
  `alternatives`, `examples`, `normative_excerpt`, `implementations`,
  `publishable_*` — are *shaped by the design_doc medium* (a fiction or ADR
  section carries different content) and stay in the adapter, never in Layer 0.

R325 split the live model: `AtomicSection` now embeds
`mnemosyne_core::SectionSkeleton` via `#[serde(flatten)]`, so the on-disk
`workspace.atomic.json` shape stays byte-identical while the core owns the
skeleton. Still owed: `SectionFact` (the RocksDB index codec) should adopt the
same `SectionSkeleton` so log and index share one definition (A3b → B). This is
what lets new media (fiction, ADR, spec) become first-class adapters without the
core ever learning what a "rationale" or a "normative excerpt" is.

## 6. Anti-drift invariants

1. **Never delete the bitemporal foundation** (`store / facts / cascade /
   server`). It is the North Star's substrate, not dead weight. "Unused by
   today's dogfood" ≠ "wrong long-term." Converge onto it; do not amputate it.
2. **The log is the SSOT; everything else is a projection.** Never reintroduce
   a second authoritative store. RocksDB stays a rebuildable index.
3. **Don't pre-build speculative upper layers.** The SCE plugin's IR-exchange
   protocol, the narrative branch/saga API, and `MediumAdapter` methods beyond
   what a concrete medium needs are designed *when a real consumer exists* — not
   ahead of it. YAGNI gates the upper layers; it does not justify deleting the
   foundation.
4. **Core stays domain-agnostic.** Markdown, SCXML, fiction, and spec knowledge
   live in adapters/plugins, never in Layer 0.
5. **Phase 0 reaches the target foundation; Phase 1 builds narrative + SCE on
   top of it.** Get the substrate textbook-correct first.
